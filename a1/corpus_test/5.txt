Saudi Arabia has been chosen to organize the 2034 FIFA World Cup for men, following Australiaâ€™s decision to withdraw its bid shortly before the bidding deadline on Tuesday.

"Having considered the opportunity to host the FIFA World Cup and reviewing all relevant factors, we've decided not to pursue the bid for the 2034 tournament," stated Football Australia.

The Australian football authority has decided instead to focus on their candidature for hosting the Women's Asian Cup in 2026 and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2029.
