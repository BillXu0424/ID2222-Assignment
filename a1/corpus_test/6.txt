The 2034 FIFA World Cup for men will be held in Saudi Arabia after Australia retracted its bid to host the esteemed international event, just hours before the deadline for submissions last Tuesday.

“After thorough consideration of the prospect of hosting the FIFA World Cup and assessing all aspects, we have concluded to withdraw from the race for the 2034 event,” announced Football Australia.

Choosing a different strategic path, the Football Federation of Australia has instead committed to pursuing the hosting rights for the Women's Asian Cup in 2026 and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2029.
